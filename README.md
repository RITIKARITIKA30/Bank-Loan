# Bank-Loan analysis
Problem Statement: Advanced Dashboard Development for Loan Data Analysis. The current approach to loan data analysis lacks depth and
interactivity, hindering the ability to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting methods fall short in
providing a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a pressing need for
advanced dashboard design to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of our loan data.


Objective: Our objective is to craft a suite of interconnected dashboards that deliver dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data,
empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from robust data analysis. These dashboards are meticulously designed to
offer a holistic perspective on our lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating strategic
decision-making based on data-driven insights.


Dashboard 1: Executive Summary
Purpose: This dashboard provides an overview of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating the overall efficiency and
performance of our lending endeavors.
Key Features:
• Total Loan Applications: Monitor total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, scrutinizing Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable
insights.
• Total Funded Amount: Evaluate the cumulative disbursed funds and track MTD disbursements, analyzing MoM variations to discern funding
patterns.
• Total Amount Received: Assess cash inflows via total and MTD received amounts from borrowers, scrutinizing MoM fluctuations for
financial health assessment.
• Average Interest Rate: Determine the cost of lending by computing and tracking the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD
and MoM changes.
• Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrowers' financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans and monitoring
